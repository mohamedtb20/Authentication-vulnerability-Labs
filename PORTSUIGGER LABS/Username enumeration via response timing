goal : is to find the true username and the true password 

sometimes when brute-forcing a list of usernames the time of response between a true and false response is too long so we can use
this to know our true username

problem : there are few possibilities to try a username/password in this lab you shouyld wait after 2 try 30 minutes to retry
solution : The HTTP X-Forwarded-For header is used to identify the clientâ€™s original IP address. 
If he is supported on a website we can you use it to spoof our ip address and impassing ip-based protection by just adding X-Forwarded-For to our request  response and bruteforcing the number of this http headers

steps :
1-we have a list of username and password 
2-we try a false username and password we take this request response on our burp suite intruder
3-we make our intruder position on Pitchfork : to have a the possibility to have a multiple payloads
4-we add the X-Forwarded-For header in our request response and we make the numbers of this headers in enumiration in the first payload
5-we make the list of usernames on the second payload
6-not obligatory but it's  preferable to make a long password to see the difference on the response time
7-the true username is probably the one with the long response time that's mean the long response recieved time
8-we take this username and we change second payload to enumirate the list of passwords
9-finnaly we found the right password and username
