sometimes the eurror message if just the username is false is different if both of the username and the password are false,we can use
this thought to know the right username and the right password

1-we have a list of username and password 
2-we use burpsuite intruder to enumerate the list of usernames we have on the list of usernames
3-we add an option that give us more result when brut forcing the username is the eurreur message when we enter false passwsord and username
'invalid username or password.'
4-in the result section we will see that there is a username with different eurror message : 'invalid username or password' without '.'

so it's the right username
we can do the same thing to brut force the list of passwords the right password with the right username we had found give us no eurror message

result : 
usename : application
password : 123456789
